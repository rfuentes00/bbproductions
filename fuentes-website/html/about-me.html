            <h2> bio </h2>
            <p> born in the united states but moved to the phillipines for university. i'm an ateneo football player who takes pictures on the side. my work in photography is basic as i just started out in the field. early employment by my high school's volleyball team as a gameday photographer allowed me to practice my skills. learning each and everyday, i quickly wanted to expand my subject matter to street photography. going out with my friends often, i took my camera everywhere we went and made our small town into one big studio. it didn't matter where they were or what they were doing, any moment was an opportunity for a picture. being that my family travels a lot, landscapes were also intriguing to me. so, naturally i started taking pictures of those too. still learning and very busy, hopefully i find time to take pictures again. </p>
